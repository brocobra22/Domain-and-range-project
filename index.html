    <P id="p2tag"><h2>Domain</h2></P>
    <p id="p3tag">
         In mathematics, the domain refers to the set of all possible 
        input values (x) for a

             <a href="" id="aoffunction" data-tooltip="A function is a special type of a relation in which, the X components are different.">function</a>
          
         or  
         <a href="" id="aofrelation" data-tooltip="A relation is the set of orderpairs.Or it cna also be defined as a Cartesian Product ">relation.</a>
         It represents the values for 
        
        which the function or relation is defined and meaningful.
        When defining a function, you typically specify its domain to indicate the
         range of valid inputs for that particular function. Some functions may have
          restrictions or limitations on the values that can be plugged into them, 
          while others may be defined for all possible values within a certain mathematical set.
        For example:
        - The function f(x) = √x (square root of x) has a domain of all non-negative
         real numbers (x ≥ 0), since the square root of a negative number is undefined 
         
         within the real number system.
        - The function g(x) = 1/x has a domain of all real numbers except zero, as division 
        by zero is undefined and leads to mathematical inconsistencies.
        - The function h(x) = x^2 has a domain of all real numbers since any real number 
        can be squared without any restrictions.
        In some cases, the domain may be further restricted due to practical considerations
        
        or specific problem contexts. For instance, a real-world function could have limitations 
        imposed by <a href="" id="aofphysicalconstraints" data-tooltip=" They are used to test values inserted into the database and to test queries to make sure that a comparison is valid">physical constraints</a> or other external factors.
        It is important to specify the domain when defining a function as it helps determine the
         valid inputs and ensures the function is well-defined for those inputs.</p>
          
           <p id="p4tag"><h2>Range</h2></p>

         <p id="p5tag">
        In mathematics, the term "range" refers to the set of all possible output 
        values (y) that a function or relation can yield. It represents the set of
         values obtained by applying the function to the elements of its domain.
        To determine the range of a function or relation, one considers all the possible 
        results obtained when the function is evaluated for various input values.
        For example:
        - The function f(x) = x^2 has a range of all non-negative real numbers (y ≥ 0) 
        since squaring any real number will yield a non-negative result.
         - The function g(x) = sin(x) has a range of all real numbers between -1 and 1 
         inclusive (-1 ≤ y ≤ 1) since the sine function oscillates between those values.
        - The function h(x) = 1/x has a range of all real numbers except zero, as division 
        by zero is undefined, and hence, zero is not included in the range.
       The range of a function can be limited by various factors, such as the specific 
       mathematical properties of the function, its domain, or any restrictions or conditions 
       imposed on its outputs.
       It's important to note that to determine the range of a function, one typically analyzes 
       the function itself, considering its properties and behavior, rather than relying solely on the domain or the set of all possible output values in general
